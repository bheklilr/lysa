\ch{Basic arithmetic}
\label{basic-arithmetic}

This is a review section.

We are going to start with some very simple axioms about arithmetic, called the
Peano axioms. From there, we will prove all of the things we know about
addition, subtraction, multiplication, et cetera.

\s{Peano axioms}

\sss{Properties of equality}

Before this, we have to review the properties of equality. I think I mentioned
them earlier in the book. Nonetheless, I'll list them now.\cite{landau-analysis}

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexive property] $x \equiv x$
\item[Commutative property] $x = y \iff y = x \sfall x,y$
\item[Transitive property] $x = y \land y = z \implies x = z \sfall x,y,z$
\end{description}

The transitive property allows us to write things like

\begin{displaymath}
  a = b = c = d
\end{displaymath}

Without ambiguity. That is, it means

\begin{displaymath}
  a = b \land b = c \land c = d
\end{displaymath}

Because of the transitive property, it also means

\begin{displaymath}
  a = c \land d = b \land a = d
\end{displaymath}

\sss{Axioms of natural numbers}

The natural numbers are the ``whole numbers'', usually denoted as $\N$.

$$\N \ce \mset{0,1,2,3,4,\dots}$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item $0$ is a natural number.\footnote{Some people say that $1$ is the first
    natural number. It doesn't matter a whole lot, at least as far as
    construction goes. Most people nowadays start with $0$, because $0$ is the
    additive identity. That is, $a + 0 \equiv a$.}

\item For each natural number $x$, there is exactly one separate natural number,
  called the \term{successor of $x$}, denoted $\succ{x}$. $\suc$ is a function,
  which means it is transparent. So:

  \begin{displaymath}
    x = y \implies \succ{x} = \succ{y} \sfall x,y \in \N
  \end{displaymath}

  The successor is the next number. So, $\succ{0} = 1$, $\succ{1} = 2$,
  $\succ{2} = 3$, et cetera. This also means that we can define every natural
  number as some succession from $0$:

  $$\succ{\succ{\succ{\succ{0}}}} = 4$$

\item $\suc$ is an injection. The previous property established:

  \begin{displaymath}
    x = y \implies \succ{x} = \succ{y} \sfall x,y \in \N
  \end{displaymath}

  Since $\suc$ is an injection, the following is also true:

  \begin{displaymath}
    x = y \impliedby \succ{x} = \succ{y} \sfall x,y \in \N
  \end{displaymath}

  This is necessary to establish that there are not two numbers who have the
  same successor.

\item There is no natural number $q$ such that $\succ{q} = 0$.

\item This establishes the completeness of $\N$.

  Let there be a set $M$ such that:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $0 \in M$
  \item $x \in M \implies \succ{x} \in M$
  \end{enumerate}

  Then $M = \N$.
\end{enumerate}

\ss{Addition}

Alright, here comes a theorem!

$x \ne y \implies \succ{x} \ne \succ{y}$

\s{Addition}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $x \ne y \implies \succ{x} \ne \succ{y} \sfall x,y \in \N$
  \begin{proof}
    Else we would have $\succ{x} = \succ{y}$, and, by
    \cref{d-n-construction}, $x = y$
  \end{proof}
\item $\succ{x} \ne x$
  \begin{proof}
    Let $Q$ be the set of all $x$ for which this property holds true.

    By axiom 1, $0 \in \N$. By axiom 3, $\notexists q \in N \st \succ{q} =
    0$. Therefore $\succ{0} \ne 0$.

    By construction, if $x \in Q$, then $\succ{x} \ne x$. By the previous
    theorem, $\succ{\succ{x}} \ne \succ{x}$, which would mean that
    $\succ{x} \in Q$. Thus, by axiom 5, $Q = \N$.

    Therefore, for all $x \in \N$, $x \ne \succ{x}$
  \end{proof}

\end{enumerate}

This is unfinished.
