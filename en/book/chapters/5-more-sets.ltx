\ch{More stuff about sets}\label{ch:more-sets}

By now, you hopefully have some idea into the basic intuition behind sets and
functions. Moreover, you've proven some cool stuff about them -- for instance,
you proved that a function is invertible iff it is bijective.

That's kind of cool, right? It's much easier to verify that a function is
bijective than it is to find its inverse. So, right off the bat, you can see if
a function is invertible without trying to invert it. Despite what you may
think, a common problem in math is to find inverse functions.

Speaking of functions, I'm going to define a really simple function:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \id : a \to a \\
  \evalat{\id}{x} = x
\end{alignedmath}

That function is about as simple as functions get. It's not a very interesting
function, but it's handy when defining things.

This is a slightly less simple function, but nonetheless important

\begin{alignedmath}
  \flip : \parens{a \to b \to c} \to b \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\flip}{f, x, y} = \eva{f}{y,x}
\end{alignedmath}

It takes a function, $f$, which takes an $a$ and a $b$, and then returns another
function with the arguments flipped. You won't usually see
$\eva{\flip}{\ld{x, y} x-y, 3, 5}$ floating around. Instead

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  f & : & p \to q \to r \\
  \eva{\flip}{f} & : & q \to p \to r \\
\end{alignmath}

Here's an infix operator:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \circ : \parens{b \to c} \to \parens{a \to b} \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\parens{f \circ g}}{x} = \eva{f}{\eva{g}{x}}
\end{alignedmath}

We're going to look at some more stuff with sets.

\s{Set subtraction}

First off, we have ``set subtraction''. This is sometimes called the ``relative
complement''.

\[ P \setminus Q = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin Q} \]

$P \bs Q$ is all of the elements in $P$ that are not in $Q$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{setminus.png}
  \caption{Set subtraction}
  \label{fig:setminus}
\end{figure}

What would $P \bs P$ be, then? Well, $\nil$, of course, right! 

\[ P \setminus P = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin P} = \nil \]

Well, that looks like a contradiction, doesn't it? Well, sort of. It's a
contradiction if you assume that $P$ is nonempty --- if you assume that there is
some element in $P$ --- if an element is both in $P$ and not in $P$, that would
be madness! But, if you realize that the comprehension is the ``set of objects
satisfying the condition'', then you don't encounter a contradiction.
$P \setminus P$ is the set of all objects in $P$ that are not in $P$: there are
no elements satisfying this condition, thus $P \bs P \equiv \nil$.

\Cref{fig:setminus} explains this idea graphically.

\ss{Complement}

If $P \subof \amb$, then $\amb \setminus P$ is called the ``\term{complement} of
$P$ with respect to $\amb$''. Yes, that's compl\xti{e}ment with an 'e', not
compl\xti{i}ment, with an 'i'. 

I drew another diagram to illustrate the complement in \cref{fig:complement}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{venn-complement-2.png}
  \caption{The complement, illustrated graphically. I tried to draw an $\amb$ in
    the upper right corner. It turned out terribly.}
  \label{fig:complement}
\end{figure}

In these exercises, you are going to prove every identity there is about sets.

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{$A \bs \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \union C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \intersect \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \bs C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \intersect C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \intersect C \equiv \parens{A \cap C} \bs B \equiv A \intersect \parens{C \bs B}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \union C \equiv \parens{A \union C} \bs \parens{B \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \nil \equiv A$}
  \Exercise {$\nil \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \equiv \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \cup \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \cup B} \cap \parens{A \cup C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A^c}^c \equiv A$}
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \cap B}^c \equiv A^c \cup B^c}} 
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \union B}^c \equiv A^c \cap B^c}}
\end{ExcList}

So, I'm actually not going to post solutions here. They can all be found in
\cref{d-sets}. This wastes less hard disk space. Also, if I find a mistake, I
only have to fix it once.

\s{Cartesian products}

This is actually a pretty simple thing:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \times : \Setof{a} \to \Setof{b} \to \Classof{a,b} \\
  A \times B = \mset{\mvec{x,y} \st x \in A \land y \in B} \\
\end{alignedmath}

It's the \sout{set} class of all pairs of the elements in either set.

\xtb{When are you going to tell me what a class is?}

We'll get there later in the chapter, don't worry.

\s{Numeric sets}

There are a number of sets with which we commonly deal. The first of them is the
``natural numbers'', or $\N$. $\N \ce \mset{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots}$. Some people will
say that $\N \ce \mset{1,2,3,4,5,\dots}$. It doesn't matter a whole lot.

The best way to explain the natural numbers --- more importantly, to reason
about them --- is to do so rigorously. These are called the \term{Peano
  axioms}. They rigorously define $\N$.\cite{landau-analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $0 \in \N$
\item $\parens{a = b} \land \parens{a \in \N} \implies b \in \N$
\item $\suc : \N \to \N$. \nm\suc\ is the ``successor function''. It just bumps
  every number up by $1$. $\succ{0} = 1$, etc.
\item \nm\suc\ is injective.
\item $\forall x \in \N, \succ{x} \ne 0$
\end{enumerate}

I'm not going to make you do it, because it's really boring. But we can define
everything about $\N$ from these axioms. For instance, you can define addition
this way:

\begin{alignedmath}
  + : \N \to \N \to \N \\
  \succ{a + b} \ce a + \succ{b}
\end{alignedmath}

The next set is $\Z$, which is the integers.

\begin{displaymath}
  \Z \ce \mset{\dots,\ng{5},\ng{4},\ng{3},\ng{2},\ng{1},0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots}
\end{displaymath}

I think I've said this before: most people use $-5$ to say ``negative 5''. I
don't like this, because $-$ is also used for subtraction. Given that I use
$\beta$ and $\eta$ reduction quite a bit, this will get really confusing. So, in
this book, \nm{\ng{x}} refers to negative $x$.

The next set is $\R$, which is the ``real numbers''. If you write down a digit,
say $8$, write down a bunch of digits next to it, and maybe stick a decimal
point in there, it's guaranteed to be a real number.

\[ 8.28302382881883842048276545678943223689076 \in \R \]

These can even go on infinitely:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \frac{1}{3} \ce 0.33333\dots \\
  e \ce 2.71828182845905\dots \\
\end{alignedmath}
The next set is $\Q$, which is the ``rational numbers'': numbers which can be
expressed as a ratio.

\begin{displaymath}
  \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \in \R \st x, y \in \Z \land y \ne 0 }
\end{displaymath}

All real numbers that follow a pattern, or terminate at some point are rational
numbers. So $\frac{1}{3}$ is a rational number, because it is a ratio. Also,
$0.333333\dots$ follows a pretty recognizable pattern.

$e$ on the other hand is \term{irrational}: it doesn't follow any pattern nor
does it terminate. $\pi$ is much more widely known than $e$, and is also
irrational.\footnote{If you don't know why $\pi$ is significant, it's the ratio
  of the circumference of a circle (the distance around it) to its diameter (the
  distance across the circle).}

Irrational numbers are the non-rational numbers:

\begin{displaymath}
  \I \ce \R \bs \Q
\end{displaymath}

The next set is the ``complex numbers'':

\begin{displaymath}
  \C \ce \R \times \R
\end{displaymath}

$\C$ is the Cartesian product of \nm\R\ with itself. The rules for addition,
division, and multiplication are a bit different. We'll get there later.

It's assumed that you already know the basic properties of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's also assumed that you know what
exponentiation is. If not, see \cref{d-special-sets}.

\s{Russell's paradox}

You know how whenever we make a set comprehension, like
$\mset{x \in A \st \eva{p}{x}}$, we always have to specify the $x \in A$ part?
Why can't we just leave it at $x$?

For a long time, set theorists did this. It worked fine, everyone was
happy. But, oh no, someone of course had to ruin the fun. In 1901, some jerk
named Bertrand Russell found a paradox. Consider the set of all sets. (Hint:
this isn't a set, actually).

\[ \mset{x \st x : \Set }\]

Okay, let's consider the set of all sets, where any given set is not an element
of itself:

\[ A = \mset{x : \Set \st x \notin x }\]

Okay... what's the point. Well, is $A$ an element of itself?  In order for $A$
to be an element of itself, $A$ would have to not be an element of itself. So,
if $A$ is an element of itself, then it's not an element of itself. Likewise, if
$A \notin A$, then $A \in A$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{russell.png}
  \caption{Said turdbucket. Doesn't he just look really smug? Source: \cite{russellpic}.}
  \label{fig:russell}
\end{figure}

Because of this little turdbucket, we can only use set comprehensions to make
\xti{subsets} of other sets.

\xtb{However}

We can use the set comprehension notation to make collections, with no guarantee
that the collection is a set. Said collections are called
\term{classes}. Because of Russell's paradox, given a class $C$ and an object
$x$, we can no longer ask $x \Qin C$. Oh well. Well now you know what classes
are.

If a class is not also a set, then it's called a \term{proper class}.

\ss{ZFC}

Russell's paradox highlighted a more important issue: we can't use a lax
interpretation of set theory, or feces start to hit the fan. So, what do we do?

Luckily enough, someone else figured out a rigorous interpretation of set
theory. That guy was named Ernst Zermelo. Another guy, named Abraham Fraenkel,
later came on by and significantly improved Zermelo's work. The result is the
modern version of set theory, called \term{Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory}, or just
ZFC.

\xtb{Wait, ZFC? I get the ZF part, where'd that C come from?}

You caught me. To explain this, I need to give you a bit of a history lesson.

Cantor (the guy who first studied sets) came up with the bizarre result that
there are multiple kinds of infinities. One such infinity was called $\aleph_0$,
which is ``countably infinite''.\footnote{$\aleph$ is the Hebrew letter
  ``aleph''.} $\N$, $\Q$, and $\Z$ all have the infinity $\aleph_0$. The next
infinity was the ``continuous infinity''. Namely, Cantor claimed that every
nonempty subset of $\R$ was in one-to-one correspondence with
$\mset{x \in \R \st 0 < x < 1}$. This was called the ``continuum
hypothesis''.\footnote{\xtb{Spoiler alert}, the continuum hypothesis is true.}

Zermelo's version of set theory came about in an effort to prove Georg Cantor's
continuum hypothesis. Zermelo came up with eight axioms for sets, and used them
to prove the continuum hypothesis, along with a bunch of other cool
stuff.\footnote{\cite{expeditions} has a wonderful account, I highly recommend you read
  it.}

In his proofs, Zermelo made an assumption: given a nonempty subset of an
infinite set, it's always possible to pick a member of the subset. This
assumption was being made all over mathematics at the time, but nobody realized
it. Zermelo's proof hinged on this assumption. This assumption later became
known as its own axiom: \term{the Axiom of Choice}.

Now, this axiom itself is not too controversial. It seems reasonable, doesn't
it? Well, sure. However, some of the results it produces are just bizarre. For
instance, someone proved, using the axiom of choice: if you have a finitely
large sphere, and cut it up into a bunch of smaller spheres, you can then
combine those smaller spheres up into an arbitrarily large sphere. That's just
weird.

You need the axiom of choice to do a lot of interesting stuff: namely, to prove
the continuum hypothesis. So, ZF set theory with the axiom of choice is called
ZFC. Set theory without the axiom of choice is called ZF. The axioms are really
boring, and they aren't really needed for our purposes, so I put them in
\cref{d-sets} instead of listing them here.

\end{figure}

At a certain point, mathematicians stopped caring whether or not their work was
true, and only cared whether or not it was rigorous. ZFC is rigorous, even if it
isn't true. So, who cares? ZFC is a lot easier than ZF, so we're going to use
ZFC. All good?
