\ch{More stuff about sets}\label{ch:more-sets}

By now, you hopefully have some idea into the basic intuition behind sets and
functions. Moreover, you've proven some cool stuff about them -- for instance,
you proved that a function is invertible iff it is bijective.

That's kind of cool, right? It's much easier to verify that a function is
bijective than it is to find its inverse. So, right off the bat, you can see if
a function is invertible without trying to invert it. Despite what you may
think, a common problem in math is to find inverse functions.

Speaking of functions, I'm going to define a really simple function:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \id : a \to a \\
  \evalat{\id}{x} = x
\end{alignedmath}

That function is about as simple as functions get. It's not a very interesting
function, but it's handy when defining things.

This is a slightly less simple function, but nonetheless important

\begin{alignedmath}
  \flip : \parens{a \to b \to c} \to b \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\flip}{f, x, y} = \eva{f}{y,x}
\end{alignedmath}

It takes a function, $f$, which takes an $a$ and a $b$, and then returns another
function with the arguments flipped. You won't usually see
$\eva{\flip}{\ld{x, y} x-y, 3, 5}$ floating around. Instead

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  f & : & p \to q \to r \\
  \eva{\flip}{f} & : & q \to p \to r \\
\end{alignmath}

Here's an infix operator:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \circ : \parens{b \to c} \to \parens{a \to b} \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\parens{f \circ g}}{x} = \eva{f}{\eva{g}{x}}
\end{alignedmath}

We're going to look at some more stuff with sets.

\s{Set subtraction}

First off, we have ``set subtraction''. This is sometimes called the ``relative
complement''.

\[ P \setminus Q = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin Q} \]

$P \bs Q$ is all of the elements in $P$ that are not in $Q$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{setminus.png}
  \caption{Set subtraction}
  \label{fig:setminus}
\end{figure}

What would $P \bs P$ be, then? Well, $\nil$, of course, right! 

\[ P \setminus P = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin P} = \nil \]

Well, that looks like a contradiction, doesn't it? Well, sort of. It's a
contradiction if you assume that $P$ is nonempty --- if you assume that there is
some element in $P$ --- if an element is both in $P$ and not in $P$, that would
be madness! But, if you realize that the comprehension is the ``set of objects
satisfying the condition'', then you don't encounter a contradiction.
$P \setminus P$ is the set of all objects in $P$ that are not in $P$: there are
no elements satisfying this condition, thus $P \bs P \equiv \nil$.

\Cref{fig:setminus} explains this idea graphically.

\ss{Complement}

If $P \subof \amb$, then $\amb \setminus P$ is called the ``\term{complement} of
$P$ with respect to $\amb$''. Yes, that's compl\xti{e}ment with an 'e', not
compl\xti{i}ment, with an 'i'. 

I drew another diagram to illustrate the complement in \cref{fig:complement}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{venn-complement-2.png}
  \caption{The complement, illustrated graphically. I tried to draw an $\amb$ in
    the upper right corner. It turned out terribly.}
  \label{fig:complement}
\end{figure}

In these exercises, you are going to prove every identity there is about sets.

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{$A \bs \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \union C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \intersect \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \bs C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \intersect C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \intersect C \equiv \parens{A \cap C} \bs B \equiv A \intersect \parens{C \bs B}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \union C \equiv \parens{A \union C} \bs \parens{B \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \nil \equiv A$}
  \Exercise {$\nil \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \equiv \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \cup \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \cup B} \cap \parens{A \cup C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A^c}^c \equiv A$}
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \cap B}^c \equiv A^c \cup B^c}} 
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \union B}^c \equiv A^c \cap B^c}}
\end{ExcList}

So, I'm actually not going to post solutions here. They can all be found in
\cref{d-sets}. This wastes less hard disk space. Also, if I find a mistake, I
only have to fix it once.

\s{Cartesian products}

This is actually a pretty simple thing:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \times : \Setof{a} \to \Setof{b} \to \Classof{a,b} \\
  A \times B = \mset{\mvec{x,y} \st x \in A \land y \in B} \\
\end{alignedmath}

It's the \sout{set} class of all pairs of the elements in either set.

\xtb{When are you going to tell me what a class is?}

We'll get there later in the chapter, don't worry.

\s{Numeric sets}

There are a number of sets with which we commonly deal. The first of them is the
``natural numbers'', or $\N$. $\N \ce \mset{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots}$. Some people will
say that $\N \ce \mset{1,2,3,4,5,\dots}$. It doesn't matter a whole lot.

The best way to explain the natural numbers --- more importantly, to reason
about them --- is to do so rigorously. These are called the \term{Peano
  axioms}. They rigorously define $\N$.\cite{landau-analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $0 \in \N$
\item $\suc : \N \to \N$. \nm\suc\ is the ``successor function''. It just bumps
  every number up by $1$. $\succ{0} = 1$, etc.
\item \nm\suc\ is injective.
\item $\forall x \in \N, \succ{x} \ne 0$
\item Let $\psi$ be a function
  \begin{alignedmath}
    \psi : \N \to \bool \\
    \eva{\psi}{0} = \true \\
  \end{alignedmath}

  If $\eva{\psi}{n} = \true \implies \eva{\psi}{\succ{n}} = \true$, then $\eva{\psi}{n}$
  holds true for all $n \in \N$.
\end{enumerate}

I'm not going to make you do it, because it's really boring. But we can define
everything about $\N$ from these axioms. For instance, you can define addition
this way:

\begin{alignedmath}
  + : \N \to \N \to \N \\
  \succ{a + b} \ce a + \succ{b}
\end{alignedmath}

The next set is $\Z$, which is the integers.

\begin{displaymath}
  \Z \ce \mset{\dots,\ng{5},\ng{4},\ng{3},\ng{2},\ng{1},0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots}
\end{displaymath}

I think I've said this before: most people use $-5$ to say ``negative 5''. I
don't like this, because $-$ is also used for subtraction. Given that I use
$\beta$ and $\eta$ reduction quite a bit, this will get really confusing. So, in
this book, \nm{\ng{x}} refers to negative $x$.

The next set is $\R$, which is the ``real numbers''. If you write down a digit,
say $8$, write down a bunch of digits next to it, and maybe stick a decimal
point in there, it's guaranteed to be a real number.

\[ 8.28302382881883842048276545678943223689076 \in \R \]

These can even go on infinitely:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \frac{1}{3} \ce 0.33333\dots \\
  e \ce 2.71828182845905\dots \\
\end{alignedmath}
The next set is $\Q$, which is the ``rational numbers'': numbers which can be
expressed as a ratio.

\begin{displaymath}
  \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \in \R \st x, y \in \Z \land y \ne 0 }
\end{displaymath}

All real numbers that follow a pattern, or terminate at some point are rational
numbers. So $\frac{1}{3}$ is a rational number, because it is a ratio. Also,
$0.333333\dots$ follows a pretty recognizable pattern.

$e$ on the other hand is \term{irrational}: it doesn't follow any pattern nor
does it terminate. $\pi$ is much more widely known than $e$, and is also
irrational.\footnote{If you don't know why $\pi$ is significant, it's the ratio
  of the circumference of a circle (the distance around it) to its diameter (the
  distance across the circle).}

Irrational numbers are the non-rational numbers:

\begin{displaymath}
  \I \ce \R \bs \Q
\end{displaymath}

The next set is the ``complex numbers'':

\begin{displaymath}
  \C \ce \R \times \R
\end{displaymath}

$\C$ is the Cartesian product of \nm\R\ with itself. The rules for addition,
division, and multiplication are a bit different. We'll get there later.

It's assumed that you already know the basic properties of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's also assumed that you know what
exponentiation is. If not, see \cref{d-special-sets}.
