\s{Russell's paradox}

You know how whenever we make a set comprehension, like
$\mset{x \in A \st \eva{p}{x}}$, we always have to specify the $x \in A$ part?
Why can't we just leave it at $x$?

For a long time, set theorists did this. It worked fine, everyone was
happy. But, oh no, someone of course had to ruin the fun. In 1901, some jerk
named Bertrand Russell found a paradox. Consider the set of all sets. (Hint:
this isn't a set, actually).

\[ \mset{x \st x : \Set }\]

Okay, let's consider the set of all sets, where any given set is not an element
of itself:

\[ A = \mset{x : \Set \st x \notin x }\]

Okay... what's the point. Well, is $A$ an element of itself?  In order for $A$
to be an element of itself, $A$ would have to not be an element of itself. So,
if $A$ is an element of itself, then it's not an element of itself. Likewise, if
$A \notin A$, then $A \in A$.

Because of this little turdbucket, we can only use set comprehensions to make
\xti{subsets} of other sets.

\xtb{However}

We can use the set comprehension notation to make collections, with no guarantee
that the collection is a set. Said collections are called
\term{classes}. Because of Russell's paradox, given a class $C$ and an object
$x$, we can no longer ask $x \Qin C$. Oh well. Well now you know what classes
are.

If a class is not also a set, then it's called a \term{proper class}.

\ss{ZFC}

Russell's paradox highlighted a more important issue: we can't use a lax
interpretation of set theory, or feces start to hit the fan. So, what do we do?

Luckily enough, someone else figured out a rigorous interpretation of set
theory. That guy was named Ernst Zermelo. Another guy, named Abraham Fraenkel,
later came on by and significantly improved Zermelo's work. The result is the
modern version of set theory, called \term{Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory}, or just
ZFC.

\xtb{Wait, ZFC? I get the ZF part, where'd that C come from?}

You caught me. To explain this, I need to give you a bit of a history lesson.

Cantor (the guy who first studied sets) came up with the bizarre result that
there are multiple kinds of infinities. One such infinity was called $\aleph_0$,
which is ``countably infinite''.\footnote{$\aleph$ is the Hebrew letter
  ``aleph''.} $\N$, $\Q$, and $\Z$ all have the infinity $\aleph_0$. The next
infinity was the ``continuous infinity''. Namely, Cantor claimed that every
nonempty subset of $\R$ was in one-to-one correspondence with
$\mset{x \in \R \st 0 < x < 1}$. This was called the ``continuum
hypothesis''.\footnote{\xtb{Spoiler alert}, the continuum hypothesis is true.}

Zermelo's version of set theory came about in an effort to prove Georg Cantor's
continuum hypothesis. Zermelo came up with eight axioms for sets, and used them
to prove the continuum hypothesis, along with a bunch of other cool
stuff.\footnote{\cite{expeditions} has a wonderful account, I highly recommend you read
  it.}

In his proofs, Zermelo made an assumption: given a nonempty subset of an
infinite set, it's always possible to pick a member of the subset. This
assumption was being made all over mathematics at the time, but nobody realized
it. Zermelo's proof hinged on this assumption. This assumption later became
known as its own axiom: \term{the Axiom of Choice}.

Now, this axiom itself is not too controversial. It seems reasonable, doesn't
it? Well, sure. However, some of the results it produces are just bizarre. For
instance, someone proved, using the axiom of choice: if you have a finitely
large sphere, and cut it up into a bunch of smaller spheres, you can then
combine those smaller spheres up into an arbitrarily large sphere. That's just
weird.

You need the axiom of choice to do a lot of interesting stuff: namely, to prove
the continuum hypothesis. So, ZF set theory with the axiom of choice is called
ZFC. Set theory without the axiom of choice is called ZF. The axioms are really
boring, and they aren't really needed for our purposes, so I put them in
\cref{d-sets} instead of listing them here.

At a certain point, mathematicians stopped caring whether or not their work was
true, and only cared whether or not it was rigorous. ZFC is rigorous, even if it
isn't true. So, who cares? ZFC is a lot easier than ZF, so we're going to use
ZFC. All good?
