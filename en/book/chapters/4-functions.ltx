\ch{Functions}

As promised, this chapter discusses functions.

So, what is a function? 

So far, we've been dealing with \xti{values} - like $2$, $\mset{3,2,5}$, and
$90$. They are static. Static things are fine, but they aren't very
interesting. It's much more interesting to examine \xti{changing things} ---
more specifically, things that change \xti{predictably} and \xti{transparently}.

Enter the \term{function}. It's a mathematical construct. A function takes some
input, and maps it to an output. Functions are sometimes referred to as
\term{mappings} or \term{morphisms}.

Let's look at a simple function, which takes a number and adds $2$ to it

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \Z \to \Z \\
  f = \fn{x}{x + 2}
\end{alignedmath}

Pretty simple, right? Okay, so what happens when we send $28$ to $f$?

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  \evalat{f}{x=28} & = & \fn{x=28}{28 + 2} \\
                   & = & 30 \\
\end{alignmath}

Alternatively, since it's obvious we're working with $x$:

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  \evalat{f}{28} & = & 28 + 2 \\
                 & = & 30 \\
\end{alignmath}

Using the lambda --- $\lambda$ --- is common when I am using a function without
giving it a name. However, usually I will use this notation:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \Z \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x} =  x + 2
\end{alignedmath}

The whole $f : \Z \to \Z$ thing should be pretty obvious. If not, it means that
$f$ is a function that takes a member of $\Z$ (the whole numbers, both negative
and positive), and takes it to another member of $\Z$. Other people might use
the notation

\[ \Z \stackrel{f}{\to} \Z \]

That notation is undoubtedly easier to understand. However, as we'll see, that
notation quickly becomes unfeasible.

\ss{Functions with multiple arguments}

Remember my explanation of vectors earlier? If not, vectors are like sets,
but order and repetition matter.

Here's a function that takes two arguments, and adds them to each other.

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \mvec{\Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x,y} = x + y \\
\end{alignedmath}

Pretty easy to understand, right?


If you haven't figured it out from the context, the inputs to the function are
called the \term{arguments}.

Here's a similar function that takes three arguments and adds them to each other

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \mvec{\Z, \Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x,y,z} = x + y + z \\
\end{alignedmath}

You can name your function anything you want, same with the arguments (it
doesn't have to be $f$). It's just a common convention, which you don't have to
follow.

\xtb{What if I want to add a bunch of things together?}

Good idea! 

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \mvec{\Z, \Z, \dots, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n} = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \dots + x_n
\end{alignedmath}

That however isn't ideal, because we have no guarantee that the arguments in the
\dots are actually integers. How about we have a \xti{set} of integers, and we
just take the sum? This has the added benefit of less typing


\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \evalat{\Set}{\Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{s} = \sum s
\end{alignedmath}

So,

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  \evalat{f}{\mset{1,2,3,4,5}} & = & \sum \mset{1,2,3,4,5} \\
                               & = & 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\\
                               & = & 15 \\
\end{alignmath}

\ss{Eta-reductions}

\nocite{eta-conversion}

Mathematicians like to make themselves look smart. One such way is to invent
fancy terms for simple things. One such term is the $\eta$-reduction.

Let's look at that function we just had

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \evalat{\Set}{\Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{s} = \sum s
\end{alignedmath}

Notice that we are repeating $s$ on both sides of the equation. It would seem
much simpler, and just as clear, to write:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \evalat{\Set}{\Z} \to \Z \\
  f = \sum
\end{alignedmath}

That's all an $\n$-reduction is: if you see an extraneous argument, you remove
it to make things simpler.  As long as we have the signature --- the
$f : \evalat{\Set}{\Z} \to \Z$ thing -- it's pretty clear what $f$ does. This is
a prime example of mathematicians being both lazy and pretentious at the same
time: a practice designed to allow us to be lazier, to which mathematicians have
assigned a ridiculous name to make it sound hard.

\xtb{What the hell is $\n$?}

$\n$ is the Greek letter eta; it's pronounced ``eight-uh''.

The ancient Greeks were too dumb to comprehend the concept of ``eight''. Every
time someone brought it up, they said ``uh'' immediately thereafter. The sound
``eight-uh'' became so common that they decided to make it a letter.

The Greeks' poor comprehension of simple mathematics remains to this day, and
is largely the reason for their current financial
crisis.\cite{w-greek-finance}

If you ever take a physics course, you will undoubtedly notice that Greek
letters are used frequently in physics. This is the physicists way of subtly
hinting that they actually have no idea what they are talking about, and
pleading for help from the mathematicians. 

\s{Currying}

We sort of got side-tracked by toying around with sets and making fun of
physicists. Hopefully that introduction introduced you to the basic concept of a
function, and let you know that they can take multiple arguments

Let's look at that function again:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \mvec{\Z, \Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x,y,z} = x + y + z \\
\end{alignedmath}

What if you wanted to bind $x = 3$, but leave the rest ``free''?

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \mvec{\Z, \Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{x=3,y,z} = 3 + y + z \\
\end{alignedmath}

Okay, cool. We now have another function:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \evalat{f}{3} : \mvec{\Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \evalat{f}{3,y,z} = 3 + y + z \\
\end{alignedmath}

So, actually, instead of needing 3 integers to do its job, $f$ only needed
one. However, instead of spitting out another integer, it spit out a
function. So, we could write $f$'s signature as:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \Z \to \parens{\mvec{\Z, \Z} \to \Z }\\
  \evalat{f}{x,y,z} = x + y + z \\
\end{alignedmath}

Okay, that's sort of weird and unintuitive. Let's try writing $f$ differently:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \Z \to \parens{\mvec{\Z, \Z} \to \Z }\\
  f = \ld{x}\parens{\ld{y,z} x + y + z} \\
\end{alignedmath}

Let's look at the second half of that:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \ld{y,z} x + y + z : \mvec{\Z,\Z} \to \Z \\
\end{alignedmath}

(This assumes that we know what $x$ is)

Let's try splitting this up again:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \ld{y}\parens{\ld{z} x + y + z} : \Z \to \parens{\Z \to \Z} \\
\end{alignedmath}

You give this function a value for $y$, and instead of giving you a value, it
gives you another function, hence the signature \nm{\Z \to \parens{\Z \to \Z}}.

Let's plug this back into $f$:

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \Z \to \parens{\Z \to \parens{\Z \to \Z}}\\
  f = \ld{x}\parens{\ld{y}\parens{\ld{z} x + y + z} }  \\
\end{alignedmath}

So, instead of $f$ taking three integers, it now only takes one, but spits out a
function, which in turn spits out a function, which spits out an integer.

This idea of making a function into a chain of functions is called
``Currying''.\cite{w-currying} It's named after a dead mathematician named
Haskell Curry (ca. 1900-1982), who developed the technique. The programming
language Haskell is also named after Mr. Curry.

Getting back to that function, those parentheses are somewhat burdensome, let's
get rid of them

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  f & : & \Z \to \Z \to \Z \to \Z\\
  f & = & \ld{x} \ld{y} \ld{z} x + y + z  \\
  \evalat{f}{x,y,z} & = & x + y + z  \\
\end{alignmath}

That's much easier to read. It should be understood that the parentheses are
right-associative: the parentheses ``associate'' rightward --- i.e. it's
$a \to \parens{b \to \parens{c \to d}}$, not
$\parens{\parens{a \to b} \to c} \to d$.\cite{w-operator-associativity}

That's Currying for you.

\s{Vocabulary}

This is important vocabulary that I'm going to use later:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All functions are \term{transparent} ---
  $a = b \implies \evalat{f}{a} = \evalat{f}{b}$

\item If $f : A \to B$, then $A$ is the \term{domain} of $f$ and $B$ is the
  \term{codomain} of $f$.

\item If $f : A \to B$, and there are no two distinct elements of $A$ that map
  to the same thing in $B$, then $f$ is \term{injective}.

  \begin{alignedmath}
    f : A \to B \\
    \notexists \mvec{a,b} \semic a,b \in A \land a \ne b \land \evalat{f}{a} = \evalat{f}{b}
    \iff \text{$f$ is injective}
  \end{alignedmath}

\item If $f : A \to B$, then the elements in $B$ that can be expressed as
  $\evalat{f}{x}\semic x \in A$ form the \term{image}.

  \begin{alignedmath}
    f : A \to B \\
    \im{f} = \mset{\evalat{f}{x} \in B\semic x \in A} \\
  \end{alignedmath}

\item If the image of a function is equal to its codomain, then the function is
  \term{surjective}.

  \begin{alignedmath}
    f : A \to B \\
    B = \mset{\evalat{f}{x} \in B\semic x \in A} \iff \text{$f$ is surjective} \\
  \end{alignedmath}

\item If a function is both injective and surjective, then it is
  \term{bijective}.

\item Some functions have \term{inverses}. That is, if
  \[ f : A \to B \]
  \begin{alignedmath}
    \arc{f} : B \to A \\
    \arc{f, x} = x \sfall x \in A
  \end{alignedmath}

  Remember that, because of currying, $\arc{f,x} = \evalat{\arc{f}}{x}$. That is:

  \begin{alignmath}{rcl}
    f & : & A \to B \\
    \mathbf{arc} & : & \parens{A \to B} \to B \to A \\
    \arc{f} & : & B \to A \\
  \end{alignmath}

  If a function has an inverse, it is said to be \term{invertible}.

\item If a function is invertible, then the image of the inverse is called the
  \term{preimage}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{I knew you were going to just gloss over those, so I made a really
    hard (i.e. fun) problem: prove that a function is invertible if (and only
    if) it is bijective. This is a very difficult proof, but you really need to
    understand it.}
