\ch{Sets}

In math, it's often useful to consider \xti{collections} of objects. There are
basically two types of collections: \term{sets} and \term{vectors}. Sets are
unordered, and multiplicity doesn't matter. Vectors are ordered, and
multiplicity does matter.

For instance, $\mset{3, 4}$ and $\mset{4,3}$ are the same \xti{set}, but
$\mvec{3,4}$ and $\mvec{4,3}$ are different \xti{vectors}.

Likewise, $\mset{20,38}$ and $\mset{38,20,38,20,20,20,20,20}$ are the same
\xti{set}. You guessed it, $\mvec{20,38}$ and $\mvec{38,20,38,20,20,20,20,20}$
are different \xti{vectors}. Sets are, for basic stuff, much more
important. Also, they are much easier to understand.

Sets were first studied to extent by Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, in
the second half of the nineteenth century. Back in his own day, the results
Cantor found by studying sets were considered so thoroughly bizarre that many of
his colleagues simply refused to believe that Cantor could be right.  In the
end, Cantor turned out to be right all along. His ideas can be found in any
introductory text on mathematics---including this one.

You probably figured it out from above: the notation is $\mset{\text{Braces}}$
for sets, and $\mvec{\text{Parentheses}}$ for vectors.

If you can't remember whether to use braces \{the curly things\}, or parentheses
(the round things), remember: \xti{a \xtb{brace} is used to \xtb{set} a broken
  bone.} I don't have a horrible pun having to do with parentheses and vectors,
and for that, I apologize.

\s{Elements}

Let's invent a set.

\[ Q = \mset{7, 7, 9, 5, 10, 1, 6, 6, 2, 10} \]

There we go. Remember, order and multiplicity don't matter. But, for the sake of
clarity, let's put the elements in order, and deduplicate them.

\[ Q = \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10} \]

Yay! You may have noticed that I slipped in the word \term{element} into the
previous sentence. Objects in the set are called \term{elements}. Yay, we
figured out what that word means!

It's too strenuous on our weak mathematical hands to write ``$10$ is an element
of $Q$'', so instead we have the symbol $\in$. $\in$ is a very terrible attempt
at drawing an E. If you can't remember what $\in$ is, think
``\raisebox{1pt}{$\in$}\hspace{0pt}lement of''.\footnote{You better think this,
  because it took me 30 minutes to get the alignment right. So, you know,
  remember $\in$ this way, or else\dots\label{30minalign}}

So, I'm going to ask you a question:

\[ 11 \Qin Q \]

(See, I used that thing from earlier with the question mark. I told you it would
help.) Well, the answer is no, $11$ is not an element of $Q$. As always,
mathematicians are too weak to write ``$11$ is not an element of $Q$'' every
time they want to say it, so instead they write

\[ 11 \notin Q \]

By contrast,

\[ 6 \in Q \]

What if we want to say ``both $6$ and $2$ are elements of $Q$''? Well, again, we
could write it out like:

\[ \parens{6 \in Q} \land \parens{2 \in Q} \]

But that's too cumbersome, so instead we'll write 

\[ 2, 6 \in Q \]

\xtb{But won't that get confusing?}

Only if we put parentheses or braces around $2$ or $6$.

\[ \mset{2, 6} \in Q \]

That's confusing, don't do that (yet).

There's one more thing I need to go over, which is the null set - it's the
simplest set, as it contains no elements. ``Null set'' takes too long to write,
so we use $\emptyset$ instead.

\s{Subsets and Supersets}

Remember when I said $\mset{2, 6} \in Q$, and we were really confused? In case
you don't remember, $Q = \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}$. $\mset{2,6}$ is obviously
not an element of $Q$. However, $\mset{2, 6}$ is \xti{in} $Q$ but it's not an
element. It's weird. How do we express this notion?

The answer is with \term{subsets}. ``Sub'' means ``smaller'', so a ``subset''
would be a ``smaller set''. $A$ is a subset of $B$ is all of the elements in $A$
are also in $B$. The notation is $A \subeq B$. Some people will read that as
``$A$ is contained in $B$''.

Referring to the previous example,

\[ \mset{2,6} \subeq Q \]

\xtb{Wait, what is with the little line under the round half circley thing?}

So, actually, there are two types of subsets - \term{proper} and
\term{improper}. $A \subeq B$ is for improper subsets. $A \subof B$ is for
proper subsets. What's the difference, then?

$A \subeq B$ allows for the possibility that $A = B$. $A \subof B$ means that
$B$ is \xti{strictly larger} than $A$; there are some elements in $B$ that are
not in $A$.

Before I go on, I'm going to define a couple of other symbols. We're constantly
saying ``this thing exists'' and ``for all'', so I'm going to add a couple of
symbols. $\exists$ is for ``there exists'' --- notice the backwards E, as in
``exists''. $\forall$ is for ``for all'' --- notice the upside-down A, as in
``all''.

So, now that you've got all of this down (hopefully), I'll give you some exercises. 

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{$\Qexists A \semic A \subof \nil$}
  \Answer{
    \nilnm, by definition, has no elements. For there to exist a proper subset
    of \nilnm, there would need to be a set with fewer elements. There cannot be
    fewer than zero elements, hence there is no proper subset of \nilnm.
  }

  \Exercise{$\forall A \semic \nil \Qsubeq A$}
  \Answer{
    Yes. It's obvious that $\nil \subof A$ if $A \ne \nil$. The only thing left
    is, $\nil \Qsubeq \nil$. $\nil \subeq \nil$ allows for $\nil = \nil$, which
    is obviously true.
  }
  
\end{ExcList}

\s{Combining sets together}

Okay, hopefully those exercises weren't too bad (\emailme\ if they were too
hard). Next, we're going to talk about ways to combine two sets together. There
are any number of ways to combine two sets. The two most common ways are through
\term{unions} and \term{intersections}.

The union symbol is pretty easy to memorize --- it looks like a giant U:
$\cup$. Think ``$\cup$nion''.\footnote{You don't have to remember it this way,
  because $\cup$ is already aligned reasonably well with the letters. Thus I
  didn't have to spend 30 minutes getting the alignment correct. (See
  \cref{30minalign}.)}.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A \cup B$ is the set of elements that are in
either $A$ or in $B$. That is:

\[ A \cup B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \lor \parens{x \in B}} \]

You might also remember this by the fact that the union symbol $\cup$ looks
vaguely like the or symbol $\lor$.

\xtb{What the hell is that notation ?}

Let's go over it.

\nm\amb\ is the ``ambient set'' -- it's a set such that $A, B \subeq \amb$. I
can't quite explain it right now, but if we don't have an ambient set, then
things go horribly wrong. \nm\amb\ is supposed to be a cursive 'A', but the font
is terrible.

\xtb{Back to business -- the intersection}

The intersection is, you guessed it - what happens when we use $\land$ in the
above definition instead of $\lor$. Can you guess what the symbol for
``intersection'' is? If you guessed $\cap$, then you are right!

\[ A \cap B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \land \parens{x \in B}} \]

The standard example is to use ``Venn diagrams''. 

FIXME: Add venn diagrams explaining $\cup$ and $\cap$.


I should remind you of the fundamental rule of algebra - what you do to one side
of $=$, you need to do to the other.

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{Given that

    \[ A \land \parens{B \lor C} = \parens{A \land B} \lor \parens{A \land C} \]

    Show that

    \[ A \lor \parens{B \land C} = \parens{A \lor B} \land \parens{A \lor C}\]

    Use these results to figure out
    \[ A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \]
    \[ A \cup \parens{B \cap C} \]
  }
  \Answer{
    
    Let's do this.

    \begin{alignmath}{rcl}
      A \land \parens{B \lor C} & = & \parens{A \land B} \lor \parens{A \land C} \\
      \text{Let } P & = & B\lor C \\
                  Q & = & A\land B \\
                  R & = & A\land C \\
      A \land P & = & Q \lor R \\
      \text{Use the definition of $\lnot$} & & \\

      \lnot\parens{A \land P} & = & \lnot\parens{Q \lor R} \\
      \lnot A \lor \lnot P & = & \lnot Q \land \lnot R \\

      \text{Expand out the definitions of $P$, $Q$, and $R$.} & & \\

      \lnot A \lor \lnot\parens{B \lor C} & = & \lnot\parens{A \land B} \land \lnot\parens{A \land C} \\
      \lnot A \lor \parens{\lnot B \land \lnot C} & = & \parens{\lnot A \lor \lnot B} \land \parens{\lnot A \lor \lnot C} \\
      \text{Let } X & = & \lnot A \\
                  Y & = & \lnot B \\
                  Z & = & \lnot C \\
      X \lor \parens{Y \land Z} & = & \parens{X \lor Y} \land \parens{X \lor Z} \\
    \end{alignmath}

    Okay, we proved the first thing (yes, this is a proof).

    Now, on to the other thing:

    \[ A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \]

    Let's write this out in comprehension notation:

    \[
    A \cap \parens{B \cup C} =
    \mset{
      x \inamb \semic
      \parens{
        x \in A
      } \lor
      \parens{
        x \in \mset {
          y \inamb \semic
          \parens{
            y \in B
          } \lor
          \parens{
            y \in C
          }
        }
      }
    }
    \]

    That probably looks horrifying to you. Trust me, it's just as bad typed out:

    \begin{plainfile}
\begin{displaymath}
  A \cap \parens{B \cup C} =
  \mset{
    x \inamb \semic
    \parens{
      x \in A
    } \land
    \parens{
      x \in \mset {
        y \inamb \semic
        \parens{
          y \in B
        } \lor
        \parens{
          y \in C
        }
      }
    }
  }
\end{displaymath}
    \end{plainfile}

    We can simplify it a bit

    \[
    A \cap \parens{B \cup C} =
    \mset{
      x \inamb \semic
      \parens{
        x \in A
      } \land
      \parens{
        \parens{
          x \in B
        } \lor
        \parens{
          x \in C
        }
      }
    }
    \]

    That's marginally less horrible

    So we have some \nm\land s and \nm\lor s hanging around. Let's use that rule
    from above!

    \[
    A \cap \parens{B \cup C} =
    \mset{
      x \inamb \semic
      \parens{
        \parens{
          x \in A
        } \land
        \parens{
          x \in B
        }
      } \lor
      \parens{
        \parens{
          x \in A
        } \land
        \parens{
          x \in C
        }
      }
    }
    \]

    But notice what we've done:
    
    \[
    A \cap \parens{B \cup C} =
    \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}
    \]

    That result is totally worth 2 pages of math.
  }

  \Exercise{Is the following true:
    \[ A \cup \nil = A \sfall A \in \Set \]
  }
  \Answer{
    Yes - the union is the set of elements in either set. Since \nm\nil\ has no
    elements, $A \cup \nil$ would just be $A$, no matter what $A$ is.
  }

  \Exercise{What about the following:
    \[ A \cap \nil = \nil \sfall A \in \Set \]
  }
  \Answer{
    Yes - the intersection of two sets is the set of objects in \xti{both}
    sets. Because \nilnm\ has no elements, there wouldn't be any objects in both
    sets --- the intersection would have no elements, which would make the
    intersection equal to \nilnm.
  }
\end{ExcList}

\s{Special kinds of sets}

Hopefully those last two exercises sparked a little lightbulb in your brain. If
not, I'll try to lay it out for you:

\begin{alignedmath}
  A \cup \nil = A \sfall A \in \Set \\
  A \cap \nil = \nil \sfall A \in \Set \\
\end{alignedmath}

Let's look at the set \nm\Z\, the set of integers:
\[
\Z = \mset{\dots `6, `5, `4, `3, `2, `1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \dots}
\]

Most people use $-$ instead of $`$ to indicate that something is
negative. However, that becomes confusing, because $-$ is also used for
subtraction (which requires two numbers).

\begin{alignedmath}
  a + 0 = a \sfall a \in \Z \\
  a \times 0 = 0 \sfall a \in \Z \\
  A \cup \nil = A \sfall A \in \Set \\
  A \cap \nil = \nil \sfall A \in \Set \\
\end{alignedmath}

Don't those look really similar? It's aggravating, isn't it - there's some
property they both share, but you can't articulate it! Luckily, you're a
mathematician, so you can abstract things.

Fortunately for you, someone else recognized this pattern a long time ago, so
they abstracted it away for you. This is called a \term{semirng} - specifically,
a \term{commutative semirng}. Semirng is a joke term originated from
``semiring'' - it's ``semiring'' without the `i' - for ``identity''.

Namely there's no fixed element $q : \Set$ for which

\[ A \cap q = A \sfall A : Set \]

(otherwise it would be a semiring)

\xtb{Okay, what the hell are you talking about?}

Mathematicians have invented all sorts of structures for these things which
share properties. All of the structures are slightly different. I'll start with
$\Set$ and $\cup$, and compare it to $\Z$ and $+$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we have to define \nm\cup. It takes 2 sets, and spits out another set

  \begin{alignedmath}
    \cup : \mvec{\Set,\Set} \to \Set \\
    + : \mvec{\Z, \Z} \to \Z \\
  \end{alignedmath}

  This properties is called ``closure'', as in, ``it's closed''. Sets can't use
  $\cup$ to escape $\Set$! The same is true with $\Z$.

\item We know that \nm\cup\ is ``associative'', which means that you can group
  operations weirdly.

  \begin{alignmath}{rl}
    A \cup \parens{B \cup C} = \parens{A \cup B} \cup C & \sfall A,B,C : \Set \\
    a + \parens{b + c} = \parens{a + b} + c             & \sfall a,b,c \in \Z \\
  \end{alignmath}

  For this reason, we can write $a + b + c + d + e$ without ambiguity.

\item We also know that \nm\cup\ is ``commutative'', which means order doesn't
  matter:

  \begin{alignmath}{rl}
    A \cup B = B \cup A & \sfall A,B : \Set \\
    a + b = b + a       & \sfall a,b \in \Z \\
  \end{alignmath}

  Think of ``commutative'' as meaning ``it commutes'', where ``commutes'' means
  ``moves''.

\item We also know that \nm\cup\ has an ``identity'' - meaning that there is an
  element in $\Set$ where $\cup$ doesn't have any effect:

  \begin{alignmath}{rl}
    A \cup \nil = A & \sfall A \in \Set \\
    a + 0 = a       & \sfall a \in \Z\\
  \end{alignmath}
\end{enumerate}

These qualities make $\mvec{\Z, +}$ and $\mvec{\Set, \cup}$ \term{commutative
  monoids}. It's one of those fancy structures mathematicians invented. Nobody
can remember the names for each one. Just Google it if you don't know. I
personally use this chart from Wikipedia: \cref{fig:groupstructures}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{group-structures.png}
  \caption{I have to use this table every time. Source: \cite{w-cats} .}
  \label{fig:groupstructures}
\end{figure}

That chart doesn't even cover all of them. Anyway, we have our commutative
monoids. I can't really go over much more without also talking about
functions. So, the next chapter focuses on functions. We'll revisit this in
Chapter 5.
