So, I've been a bit less than honest with you. I've never outright said it, but
I've sort of implied that, if you have some condition $p$, you can form a set

\[ \mset{x \mid p} \]

Remember when I brought up $\Set$, and presented it as ``the set of all sets''?
Well, surprise, I was lying! So, it turns out that, if you have some condition,
you can't always form a set based on that condition.

Case in point:

\[ A = \mset{x \mid x \notin x}\]

This should be read ``$A$ is the set of all sets $x$ for which $x$ is not an
element of itself''. With regard to $x \Qin x$, there are two possibilities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $x \in x$
\item $x \notin x$
\end{enumerate}

Okay, let's look at the entire set $A$. $A \Qin A$

Well, if $A \in A$, then it must be true that $A \notin A$, because $A$ is the
set of all sets for which $x \notin x$. However, if $A \notin A$, then
$A \in A$, because $A$ is the set of all $x$ such that $x \notin x$. Therefore,
if $A \notin A$, then $A \in A$. In essence:

\[ A \in A \iff A \notin A \]

We've found an instance in which our intuition of sets fails. A
philosopher-stroke-mathematician named Bertrand Russell was the first to point
this out, in the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century.\cite{jech-set-theory} The
conclusion to draw from this result is that we need a more formal definition of
sets, not the slimy intuitive definition we already had.

% Let's write an appendix on Bertrand Russell.

This is called ``disproof by counterexample''. We were trying to prove that some
property was universally true. However, we found one instance in which the
property was false, so therefore it can't be universally true.

Like I said above, we need some formal axioms for sets. The way we'll do this
is, instead of calling $\Set$ the ``set of all sets'', we're instead going to
call it the ``\xti{category} of sets''. Ooh yay we used the section title! So,
what's a category?
