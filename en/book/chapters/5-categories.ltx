% \ch{Categories}

% I'm briefly going to go over the history of set theory, bringing us up to date
% with modern research. We're then going to discuss the notion of a
% \term{category}, and explain how they can be used to model other parts of math.

% \s{Technically incorrect}\cref{technically-incorrect}

% Remember when I said that the set comprehension was ``technically incorrect''?
% Well, the reason is Russell's paradox.\cite{expeditions,jech-set-theory} There's
% a colloquial version of Russell's paradox called the ``Barber paradox'', and it
% is as follows:

% \begin{quote}
%   There's a barber in a small town - he cuts everybody's hair, but only if a
%   given person person doesn't cut his own hair. Does the barber cut is own hair?
% \end{quote}

% If the answer is ``yes'', we run into a problem -- if the barber cuts his own
% hair, he doesn't cut his own hair, because he only cuts someone's hair if he
% don't cut his own hair.

% If the answer is ``no'', then we run into the same problem -- the barber cuts
% someone's hair if he doesn't cut it themselves. Since the barber doesn't cut his
% own hair, he therefore cuts his own hair.

% Let's put this in mathematical notation

% \[
% \text{People whose hair barber cuts} =
% \mset{
%   \text{Person} \in \text{Town}
%   \semic
%   \text{Person doesn't cut his own hair}
% }
% \]

% The question is

% \[
% \text{Barber} \Qin \text{People whose hair barber cuts}
% \]

% The paradox is

% \[
% \text{Barber} \in \text{People whose hair barber cuts}
% \iff
% \text{Barber} \notin \text{People whose hair barber cuts}
% \]

% The version with sets is:

% \begin{alignedmath}
%   \text{let } \Set = \mset{
%     x \semic
%     x \text{ is a set}
%   } \\
%   \text{let } A = \mset{
%     x \in \Set \semic
%     x \notin x
%   } \\
%   A \Qin A
% \end{alignedmath}

% That is, $A$ is the set of all sets $x$ such that $x$ is not an element of
% itself. Is $A$ an element of itself?

% If $A$ is an element of itself, then $A$ is not an element of itself, because
% $A$ is the set of all sets in which the set is not an element of itself.

% If $A$ is not an element of itself, then $A$ must be an element of itself,
% because $A$ is the set of all sets for which that assertion holds true.

% That is:

% \[ A \in A \iff A \notin A \]

% This paradox was first proposed by a mathematician-stroke-philosopher named
% Bertrand Russell, in the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century. 

% Well, sets are still around in 2015, so someone must have solved this paradox,
% right? Indeed!

% The solution is actually quite simple - comprehensions don't necessarily form
% \xti{sets}, they instead form \term{classes}. Classes don't have things like
% $\in$ or $\subof$. Some classes are sets. Classes that are not sets are called
% \term{proper classes}.

% In order for a class to be a set, the class must draw elements from an ambient
% set.

% \[ \mset{x \in Z \semic x \ge 3} \]

% I sort of spoiled the ending for you. A much more riveting explanation of this
% can be found in \cite{expeditions}.

% \sss{Axiomizing equality}


% Before we can go any further, we have to make some rules about the $=$ sign. I
% mentioned these in \cref{2-boolean-algebra}.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item $a = a \sfall a$. This is called the \term{reflexive
%     property}. ``Reflective property'' would be a better name, because if you
%   put $a$ in front of the $=$ mirror, $a$ is there.
% \item $a = b \implies b = a \sfall a,b$. This is called the \term{commutative
%     property}. ``Commute'' means ``move'', so the ``commutative property'' is
%   the property of moving things around.
% \item $\parens{a = b} \land \parens{b = c} \implies a = c \sfall a,b,c$. This is
%   called the \term{transitive property}. "Transition" is what happens when
%   things change. so ``transitive'' property is what happens when you change the
%   variable name.
% \end{enumerate}

% Good? You don't have to remember the names of the properties, but you do have to
% remember what the properties are.
