\ch{Sets}

In math, it's often useful to consider \xti{collections} of objects. There are
basically two types of collections: \term{sets} and \term{vectors}. Sets are
unordered, and multiplicity doesn't matter. Vectors are ordered, and
multiplicity does matter.

For instance, $\mset{3, 4}$ and $\mset{4,3}$ are the same \xti{set}, but
$\mvec{3,4}$ and $\mvec{4,3}$ are different \xti{vectors}.

Likewise, $\mset{20,38}$ and $\mset{38,20,38,20,20,20,20,20}$ are the same
\xti{set}. You guessed it, $\mvec{20,38}$ and $\mvec{38,20,38,20,20,20,20,20}$
are different \xti{vectors}. Sets are, for basic stuff, much more
important. Also, they are much easier to understand.

Sets were first studied to extent by Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, in
the second half of the nineteenth century. Back in his own day, the results
Cantor found by studying sets were considered so thoroughly bizarre that many of
his colleagues simply refused to believe that Cantor could be right.  In the
end, Cantor turned out to be right all along. His ideas can be found in any
introductory text on mathematics---including this one.

You probably figured it out from above: the notation is $\mset{\text{Braces}}$
for sets, and $\mvec{\text{Parentheses}}$ for vectors.

If you can't remember whether to use braces \{the curly things\}, or parentheses
(the round things), remember: \xti{a \xtb{brace} is used to \xtb{set} a broken
  bone.} I don't have a horrible pun having to do with parentheses and lists,
and for that, I apologize.

\s{Elements}

Let's invent a set.

\[ Q = \mset{7, 7, 9, 5, 10, 1, 6, 6, 2, 10} \]

There we go. Remember, order and multiplicity don't matter. But, for the sake of
clarity, let's put the elements in order, and deduplicate them.

\[ Q = \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10} \]

Yay! You may have noticed that I slipped in the word \term{element} into the
previous sentence. Objects in the set are called \term{elements}. Yay, we
figured out what that word means!

It's too strenuous on our weak mathematical hands to write ``$10$ is an element
of $Q$'', so instead we have the symbol $\in$. $\in$ is a very terrible attempt
at drawing an E. If you can't remember what $\in$ is, think
``\raisebox{1pt}{$\in$}\hspace{0pt}lement of''.\footnote{You better think this,
  because it took me 5 minutes to get the alignment right. So, you know,
  remember $\in$ this way, or else\dots}

So, I'm going to ask you a question:

\[ 11 \Qin Q \]

(See, I used that thing from earlier with the question mark. I told you it would
help.) Well, the answer is no, $11$ is not an element of $Q$. As always,
mathematicians are too weak to write ``$11$ is not an element of $Q$'' every
time they want to say it, so instead they write

\[ 11 \notin Q \]

By contrast,

\[ 6 \in Q \]

What if we want to say ``both $6$ and $2$ are elements of $Q$''? Well, again, we
could write it out like:

\[ \parens{6 \in Q} \land \parens{2 \in Q} \]

But that's too cumbersome, so instead we'll write 

\[ 2, 6 \in Q \]

\xtb{But won't that get confusing?}

No, not if you don't but parentheses or braces around $2$ or $6$.

\[ \mset{2, 6} \in Q \]

That's confusing, don't do that (yet).
