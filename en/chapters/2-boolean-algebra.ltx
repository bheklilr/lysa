\ch{Booleans, simple logic, and simple operators}\label{booleans}

Before we get into interesting content, you have to understand some stuff. This
stuff is pretty easy. This will likely be the shortest and easiest chapter in
the book.

You might think math is about dealing with numbers and pumping out
formulas. Well, that's not what math is about. As said in \cref{intro-idris},
it's about using math as a language to express your thoughts. Most people don't
think about numbers all day; thus, we deal with things in math that aren't
numbers.

In this next section, we're going to outline some basic rules for reasoning
about things. You need to know these rules to do really cool stuff. Although, as
you will (hopefully) see, these rules can be fun to toy around with on their
own.

% \item $A \notiff B$ means ``Saying $A$ is not the same as saying $B$.'' Remember
%   that $A \iff B$ means $\parens{A \implies B} \land \parens{A \impliedby
%     B}$.
%   Well, $A \notiff B$ means that one of the aforementioned conditions is
%   \falsenm. Remember, when dealing with $\land$, if one of the conditions is
%   \falsenm, the greater condition is \falsenm.

% Note that in this case, $X$ and $Y$ are whole expressions, like $A = B$. They
% are technically Boolean values, but, as we'll see, that intuition tends to fail
% pretty quickly.

% \sss{Equality}

% Before we go much further, I have to make some remarks about equality of
% things. That is, the use of the $=$ sign, and of the $\ne$ sign. Those signs
% should be read as `equals' and `not equals', respectively. These statements are
% true for things that aren't Booleans, such as numbers. However, in this chapter,
% we are only going to be talking about Booleans.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item For every $A$, it is always true that $A = A$.
% \item For every $A$ and $B$, if $A = B$, then it's true that $B = A$. Using the
%   notation above,

%   \[ A = B \implies B = A\]

% \item For every $A$ and $B$, and $C$, if $A = B$ and $B = C$, then it's true
%   that $A = C$. Using the notation above,
  
%   \[\mset{A = B, B = C} \implies A = C\]

%   Because of this, I can write things like $A = B = C$ without
%   ambiguity.\footnote{A common critique of this practice has to do with
%     associativity. That is, many people read $A = B = C$ as
%     $\parens{A = B} = C$. This translates to $A = B \implies C$, which isn't
%     what we want. The solution is to not try to group the operators like that,
%     or use parentheses when you do want to group them.}
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item See if you can decipher this: $\forall A \comma \lnot\parens{A \ne A}$.
  
%   You should read that as ``for all $A$, $A \ne A$ is \falsenm.''

% \item $\forall A,B \comma \parens{A = B} \iff \not \parens{A \ne B}$
% \end{itemize}
