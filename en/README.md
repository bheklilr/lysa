# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book, licensed under the GNU FDL. It is written in English. There
is an unofficial [Russian translation](https://github.com/gazay/lysa)

# Building

If you want a pre-build PDF, see the
[pdfs repository](https://gitlab.com/lysa/pdfs).

To build a PDF from source, you'll need to have TeX installed, along with a
number of packages. A list can be found in the
[`docs/contributing.md` file](docs/contributing.md). I'm sure you can build the
project on Windows, I just don't know how (most of us use Linux). 

If you are reading this, you probably want the English version. In that case:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd lysa/en/book
./build
```

Instructions for building the versions in other languages can be found in the
respective languages' READMEs. (e.g. to build the Russian version, read
`ru/README.md`).

If you don't use git, you can get a tarball from
<https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa/repository/archive.tar.gz>. If you don't know what
a tarball is, you can get a Zip archive from
<https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa/repository/archive.zip>.

If you have a slow computer, it might take about 30 seconds or so to build. On a
fast computer, it will take less than a second.

# Community stuff

If you like chatting on IRC, come see us in `#lysa` on FreeNode. If you don't
know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up, you can connect through
[FreeNode's webchat][webchat].

If you notice any errors, don't be shy to report them in the
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa/issues). If you have any
suggestions for improving LYSA, also post them in the issue tracker (or bring
them up in the IRC channel).

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the channel,
or in the issue tracker.

# Hosting

This project is hosted on GitLab, at https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa . There are 3
official "mirrors":

* BitBucket - https://bitbucket.org/pharpend/lysa
* GitHub - https://github.com/learnyou/lysa
* Gitorious - https://gitorious.org/lysa/lysa

I accept merge requests to each of those. However, issues should be brought up
in the GitLab repository.
