# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book, licensed under the GNU FDL. It is written in English. There
is an unofficial [Russian translation](https://github.com/gazay/lysa)

# Building

If you want a pre-build PDF, see the
[pdfs repository](https://github.com/learnyou/pdfs).

To build a PDF from source, you'll need to have TeX installed, along with a
number of packages. A list can be found in the
[`docs/contributing.md` file](docs/contributing.md). I'm sure you can build the
project on Windows, I just don't know how (most of us use Linux). 

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa.git
cd lysa
./lysabuild LANG
```

Where `LANG` is one of the supported languages. Run `lysabuild help` for a list.

If you don't use git, you can get a tarball from
<https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa/repository/archive.tar.gz>. If you don't know what
a tarball is, you can get a Zip archive from
<https://gitlab.com/lysa/lysa/repository/archive.zip>.

If you have a slow computer, it might take about 30 seconds or so to build. On a
fast computer, it will take less than a second.
